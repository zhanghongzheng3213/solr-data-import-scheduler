## `Apache Solr DataImportHandler Scheduler` ##
I'm creating this project so that people don't have to build DIH Scheduler source themselves.

The source was originally published in Solr Wiki and soon after, understandably, more and more people started asking for compiled version so they can just drop a JAR file in their deployed Solr's lib folder, customize their scheduler params and start using it.

So here it is (on the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/solr-data-import-scheduler/downloads/list) page). Enjoy it and please feel free to post any questions and suggestions here.

### `About Solr` ###
[Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) is very popular, blindingly fast open source enterprise search platform from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing distributed search and index replication, and it powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.
